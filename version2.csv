response planning, response implementation, and monitoring risk on a project. The objectives of project risk management
are to increase the probability and/or impact of positive risks and to decrease the probability and/or impact of negative
risks, in order to optimize the chances of project success.
The Project Risk Management processes are:
11.1 Plan Risk ManagementóThe process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a project.
11.2 Identify RisksóThe process of identifying individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk,
and documenting their characteristics.
11.3 Perform Qualitative Risk AnalysisóThe process of prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis
or action by assessing their probability of occurrence and impact as well as other characteristics.
11.4 Perform Quantitative Risk AnalysisóThe process of numerically analyzing the combined effect of identified
individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty on overall project objectives.
11.5 Plan Risk ResponsesóThe process of developing options, selecting strategies, and agreeing on actions to
address overall project risk exposure, as well as to treat individual project risks.
11.6 Implement Risk ResponsesóThe process of implementing agreed-upon risk response plans.
11.7 Monitor RisksóThe process of monitoring the implementation of agreed-upon risk response plans,
tracking identified risks, identifying and analyzing new risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout
the project.
Figure 11-1 provides an overview of the Project Risk Management processes. The Project Management Risk processes
are presented as discrete processes with defined interfaces while, in practice, they overlap and interact in ways that
cannot be completely detailed in this PMBOKÆ Guide.
KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT
All projects are risky since they are unique undertakings with varying degrees of complexity that aim to deliver
benefits. They do this in a context of constraints and assumptions, while responding to stakeholder expectations that
may be conflicting and changing. Organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner
in order to create value while balancing risk and reward.
Project Risk Management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management
processes. When unmanaged, these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to
achieve the defined project objectives. Consequently, the effectiveness of Project Risk Management is directly related
to project success.
Risk exists at two levels within every project. Each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of
project objectives. It is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project, which arises from the combination
of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty. Project Risk Management processes address both levels of
risk in projects, and these are defined as follows:
Individual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on
one or more project objectives.
Overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty
including individual risks, representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project
outcome, both positive and negative.
Individual project risks can have a positive or negative effect on project objectives if they occur. Project Risk
Management aims to exploit or enhance positive risks (opportunities) while avoiding or mitigating negative risks
(threats). Unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay, cost overruns, performance shortfall,
or loss of reputation. Opportunities that are captured can lead to benefits such as reduced time and cost, improved
performance, or reputation.
Overall project risk can also be positive or negative. Management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk
exposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation, promoting drivers of positive variation,
and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives.

 Guide
Risks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project, so Project Risk Management processes should be conducted
iteratively. Risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy. Risk should also be monitored and
managed as the project progresses to ensure that the project stays on track and emergent risks are addressed.
In order to manage risk effectively on a particular project, the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure
is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives. This is defined by measurable risk thresholds that reflect the risk
appetite of the organization and project stakeholders. Risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around
a project objective. They are explicitly stated and communicated to the project team and reflected in the definitions of
risk impact levels for the project.
TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT
The focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered, and that project
risks are understood in a wider context. Trends and emerging practices for Project Risk Management include but are
not limited to:
Non-event risks. Most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur.
Examples of event-based risks include: a key seller may go out of business during the project, the customer may
change the requirement after design is complete, or a subcontractor may propose enhancements to the standard
operating processes.
There is an increasing recognition that non-event risks need to be identified and managed. There are two main
types of non-event risks:
un Variability risk. Uncertainty exists about some key characteristics of a planned event or activity or decision.
Examples of variability risks include: productivity may be above or below target, the number of errors found
during testing may be higher or lower than expected, or unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the
construction phase.
un Ambiguity risk. Uncertainty exists about what might happen in the future. Areas of the project where
imperfect knowledge might affect the projectís ability to achieve its objectives include: elements of the
requirement or technical solution, future developments in regulatory frameworks, or inherent systemic
complexity in the project.


Variability risks can be addressed using Monte Carlo analysis, with the range of variation reflected in probability
distributions, followed by actions to reduce the spread of possible outcomes. Ambiguity risks are managed by
defining those areas where there is a deficit of knowledge or understanding, then filling the gap by obtaining
expert external input or benchmarking against best practices. Ambiguity is also addressed through incremental
development, prototyping, or simulation.
Project resilience. The existence of emergent risk is becoming clear, with a growing awareness of so-called
unknowable-unknowns. These are risks that can only be recognized after they have occurred. Emergent risks
can be tackled through developing project resilience. This requires each project to have:
un Right level of budget and schedule contingency for emergent risks, in addition to a specific risk budget for
known risks;
un Flexible project processes that can cope with emergent risk while maintaining overall direction toward project
goals, including strong change management;
un Empowered project team that has clear objectives and that is trusted to get the job done within agreedupon limits;
un Frequent review of early warning signs to identify emergent risks as early as possible; and
un Clear input from stakeholders to clarify areas where the project scope or strategy can be adjusted in response
to emergent risks.
Integrated risk management. Projects exist in an organizational context, and they may form part of a program
or portfolio. Risk exists at each of these levels, and risks should be owned and managed at the appropriate level.
Some risks identified at higher levels will be delegated to the project team for management, and some project
risks may be escalated to higher levels if they are best managed outside the project. A coordinated approach to
enterprise-wide risk management ensures alignment and coherence in the way risk is managed across all levels.
This builds risk efficiency into the structure of programs and portfolios, providing the greatest overall value for a
given level of risk exposure.


TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS
Because each project is unique, it is necessary to tailor the way Project Risk Management processes are applied.
Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:
Project size. Does the projectís size in terms of budget, duration, scope, or team size require a more detailed
approach to risk management? Or is it small enough to justify a simplified risk process?
Project complexity. Is a robust risk approach demanded by high levels of innovation, new technology, commercial
arrangements, interfaces, or external dependencies that increase project complexity? Or is the project simple
enough that a reduced risk process will suffice?
Project importance. How strategically important is the project? Is the level of risk increased for this project
because it aims to produce breakthrough opportunities, addresses significant blocks to organizational
performance, or involves major product innovation?
Development approach. Is this a waterfall project, where risk processes can be followed sequentially and
iteratively, or does the project follow an agile approach where risk is addressed at the start of each iteration as
well as during its execution?
Tailoring of the Project Risk Management processes to meet these considerations is part of the Plan Risk Management
process, and the outcomes of tailoring decisions are recorded in the risk management plan.
CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS
High-variability environments, by definition, incur more uncertainty and risk. To address this, projects managed using
adaptive approaches make use of frequent reviews of incremental work products and cross-functional project teams to
accelerate knowledge sharing and ensure that risk is understood and managed. Risk is considered when selecting the
content of each iteration, and risks will also be identified, analyzed, and managed during each iteration.
Additionally, the requirements are kept as a living document that is updated regularly, and work may be reprioritized
as the project progresses, based on an improved understanding of current risk exposure.","Project Risk Management involves planning, identifying, analyzing, planning responses, implementing responses, and monitoring risks in a project. Its objectives are to increase positive risks and decrease negative risks to optimize project success. The processes include risk management planning, risk identification, qualitative and quantitative risk analysis, risk response planning, implementation, and risk monitoring. Risks exist at both individual and overall project levels, and Project Risk Management aims to exploit positive risks while mitigating negative risks. Trends in Project Risk Management include considering non-event risks, addressing variability and ambiguity risks, developing project resilience, and integrating risk management across all levels of an organization. Tailoring considerations for Project Risk Management include project size, complexity, importance, and development approach. In agile/adaptive environments, frequent reviews and cross-functional teams are used to address uncertainty and manage risks.","Relations:

The plan is used to guide the risk management process and ensure that risks are effectively identified, analyzed, and responded to throughout the project lifecycle. It also addresses the integration of risk management with project management activities and the need for ongoing monitoring and control. The plan should be adapted as needed to reflect changes in project needs and stakeholder expectations, and communication about risks should occur at both the project team and stakeholder levels.","Relations:

documenting their characteristics. The key benefit of this process is the documentation of existing individual project risks
and the sources of overall project risk. It also brings together information so the project team can respond appropriately
to identified risks. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the
process are depicted in Figure 11-6. Figure 11-7 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.Identify Risks considers both individual project risks and sources of overall project risk. Participants in risk
identification activities may include the following: project manager, project team members, project risk specialist
(if assigned), customers, subject matter experts from outside the project team, end users, other project managers,
operations managers, stakeholders, and risk management experts within the organization. While these personnel are
often key participants for risk identification, all project stakeholders should be encouraged to identify individual project
risks. It is particularly important to involve the project team so they can develop and maintain a sense of ownership and
responsibility for identified individual project risks, the level of overall project risk, and associated risk response actions.
When describing and recording individual project risks, a consistent format should be used for risk statements to
ensure that each risk is understood clearly and unambiguously in order to support effective analysis and risk response
development. Risk owners for individual project risks may be nominated as part of the Identify Risks process, and will
be confirmed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. Preliminary risk responses may also be identified
and recorded and will be reviewed and confirmed as part of the Plan Risk Responses process.
Identify Risks is an iterative process, since new individual project risks may emerge as the project progresses through
its life cycle and the level of overall project risk will also change. The frequency of iteration and participation in each risk
identification cycle will vary by situation, and this will be defined in the risk management plan.","The process of Identifying Risks involves identifying individual project risks and overall project risks, and documenting their characteristics. The key benefit of this process is to document existing risks and their sources, allowing the project team to respond appropriately. This process involves various participants, including the project manager, project team members, stakeholders, and risk management experts. It is important to involve the project team in order to develop a sense of ownership and responsibility for identified risks. A consistent format should be used for risk statements to ensure clear understanding and effective analysis. This process is iterative, as new risks may emerge as the project progresses. The frequency of iteration and participation will depend on the specific situation and will be defined in the risk management plan.","Relations:

The schedule baseline and cost baseline are reviewed to identify milestones, due dates, costs, and funding requirements and to address uncertainty and ambiguity. The definition of project risk includes uncertain events or conditions that may have a positive or negative effect on project objectives. Risks may be described in terms of probability and impact and can be categorized as threats or opportunities. Risks can arise from distinct events or general conditions, and they can be caused by existing circumstances or conditional future events. Proper risk descriptions include the elements of the risk event, uncertainty, and the cause-effect chain.","Relations:

It can also act as a source for identifying overall project risks. The prompt list is used as a framework to aid the project team in generating ideas through risk identification techniques. The risk categories are the lowest level of the risk breakdown structure. Examples of risk categories include PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal, environmental), TECOP (technical, environmental, commercial, operational, political), and VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity). 

To prioritize risks, probability and impact are considered. Overall project risks are evaluated based on their importance to the entire project, in contrast to the importance of specific objectives. The common reason for constructing a measure of specific risks is to facilitate communication and management with stakeholders. A single risk prioritization index is typically needed, and organizations usually create an explicit index that reflects their preference among objectives. The technique for creating an overall risk priority measure is documented in the plan for the risk management process. This involves performing qualitative risk analysis to categorize the causes of risk.","Relations:

For smaller projects, a subset of the project team can identify risks. Planning sessions are recommended to develop a common understanding of the project's risk approach and gain agreement from project stakeholders. The risk management plan serves as a means to develop an effective team collaboration. Participants in the risk management process include the project manager, selected team members, stakeholders, and subject matter experts. Facilitators are needed to be responsible for initial risk responsibilities.

subjective as they are based on perceptions of risk by the project team and other stakeholders. Effective assessment
therefore requires explicit identification and management of the risk attitudes of key participants in the Perform

success factors perform quantitative risk analysis process,"Data analysis techniques used in the risk management process include limited risk data quality assessment. This assessment evaluates the degree to which the data on individual project risks are accurate and reliable. Qualitative risk analysis may be of little use if the risk data quality is unacceptable, so it may be necessary to gather better data. Risk data quality can be assessed through a questionnaire measuring stakeholder perceptions of various characteristics such as completeness, objectivity, relevancy, and timeliness. The weighted average of these selected data quality characteristics can give an overall quality score. The probability and impact of individual project risks are assessed through interviews and meetings with participants who are familiar with the risks. These risks are recorded in a risk register, and differences in perception of probability and impact are explored in detail, including justifying the levels assigned. Risk parameters such as urgency, proximity, dormancy, manageability, controllability, detectability, connectivity, strategic impact, and propinquity are also considered in prioritizing individual project risks. The analysis also includes action characteristics such as limited urgency, proximity, and dormancy. Additionally, a quantitative risk analysis process provides a numerical estimate of the overall effect of risk on project objectives. This analysis is usually performed using techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the likelihood of success in achieving project objectives and estimate contingency reserves. The results of the quantitative analysis are compared to the project plan baseline to provide an estimate of the overall project risk. The use of quantitative risk analysis helps to distinguish projects and prioritize risks that threaten objectives beyond stakeholders' tolerance.","Relations:

Using a risk breakdown structure (RBS), risks can be categorized into useful categories such as project phase, project budget, and roles and responsibilities. These categories help determine the areas of the project that are exposed to uncertainty and the potential effects of these risks. Through the use of common root causes, risk categories can also be used to develop effective risk responses. By grouping risks into categories, attention and effort can be focused on the areas of highest risk exposure, leading to the development of generic risk responses that address related risks. Risks are linked to project objectives and are identified by considering factors such as time, cost, quality, and scope. The PMBOK Guide defines risk as an uncertain event or condition that can have a positive or negative effect on a project's objectives. Taking into consideration the project objectives, risks can be identified through a process that assists in identifying risks and completing a risk statement that notes which objectives may be affected.","Relations:

The key benefit of this process is that it quantifies overall project risk exposure, and it can also provide additional quantitative risk information to support risk response planning. This process is not required for every project, but where it is used, it is performed throughout the project. The inputs and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 11-11. Figure 11-12 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis is not required for all projects. Undertaking a robust analysis depends on the availability
of high-quality data about individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty, as well as a sound underlying project
baseline for scope, schedule, and cost. Quantitative risk analysis usually requires specialized risk software and expertise
in the development and interpretation of risk models. It also consumes additional time and cost. The use of quantitative
risk analysis for a project will be specified in the projectís risk management plan. It is most likely appropriate for large or
complex projects, strategically important projects, projects for which it is a contractual requirement, or projects in which
a key stakeholder requires it. Quantitative risk analysis is the only reliable method to assess overall project risk through
evaluating the aggregated effect on project outcomes of all individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty.
Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis uses information on individual project risks that have been assessed by the
Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process as having a significant potential to affect the projectís objectives.
Outputs from Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis are used as inputs to the Plan Risk Responses process, particularly
in recommending responses to the level of overall project risk and key individual risks. A quantitative risk analysis
may also be undertaken following the Plan Risk Responses process, to determine the likely effectiveness of planned
responses in reducing overall project risk exposure.","Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis is the process of numerically analyzing the combined effect of identified project risks and uncertainties on project objectives.

Duration estimates and milestone lists are used for evaluating schedule variability and confidence levels in achieving schedule targets. Resource requirements are evaluated to determine variability and potential risks. The risk register contains details of individual project risks used as input for quantitative risk analysis. The risk report provides an overview of the project's overall risk status. Qualitative risk analysis assesses and evaluates individual project risks based on agreed-upon characteristics, prioritizing them, and addressing the root causes and potential interactions.

These inputs include factors such as duration, cost, and resource requirements. The model uses probability distributions to represent the range of possible values for these factors. The appropriate probability distribution is selected carefully to accurately reflect the uncertainty and range of values. The model may also include probabilistic branches to represent the impact of risks on time and/or cost. These branches can indicate the relationships and dependencies between different sources of uncertainty. Monte Carlo simulation and decision trees are commonly used methods for quantitative risk analysis. These methods help to derive the overall project risk from the individual risks. By combining the effects of the risks, a measure of the overall value and cost of the project can be calculated. This process also takes into account the interrelationships between different risks. The results of the quantitative risk analysis can be used to inform decision-making and assess the potential impact of future events.","Relations:

The key benefit of this process is that it identifies appropriate ways to address overall project risk and individual project risks. This process also allocates resources and inserts activities into project documents and the project management plan as needed. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 11-16. Figure 11-17 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.Effective and appropriate risk responses can minimize individual threats, maximize individual opportunities, and
reduce overall project risk exposure. Unsuitable risk responses can have the converse effect. Once risks have been
identified, analyzed, and prioritized, plans should be developed by the nominated risk owner for addressing every
individual project risk the project team considers to be sufficiently important, either because of the threat it poses to the
project objectives or the opportunity it offers. The project manager should also consider how to respond appropriately to
the current level of overall project risk.
Risk responses should be appropriate for the significance of the risk, cost-effective in meeting the challenge, realistic
within the project context, agreed upon by all parties involved, and owned by a responsible person. Selecting the
optimal risk response from several options is often required. The strategy or mix of strategies most likely to be effective
should be selected for each risk. Structured decision-making techniques may be used to choose the most appropriate
response. For large or complex projects, it may be appropriate to use a mathematical optimization model or real options
analysis as a basis for a more robust economic analysis of alternative risk response strategies.
Specific actions are developed to implement the agreed-upon risk response strategy, including primary and backup
strategies, as necessary. A contingency plan (or fallback plan) can be developed for implementation if the selected
strategy turns out not to be fully effective or if an accepted risk occurs. Secondary risks should also be identified.
Secondary risks are risks that arise as a direct result of implementing a risk response. A contingency reserve is often
allocated for time or cost. If developed, it may include identification of the conditions that trigger its use.","Plan Risk Responses is the process of developing options, selecting strategies, and agreeing on actions to address project risk.

schedule, project team assignments, resource calendars, risk register, risk report, and stakeholder register. The purpose of the risk response planning process is to determine a set of actions that will enhance the chances of project success while complying with organizational project constraints. The process involves analyzing and prioritizing risks, developing plans to address each risk, and assigning responsibilities for implementing the risk responses. The risk action owner is responsible for ensuring that the agreed-upon risk responses are carried out in a timely manner, while the risk owner is responsible for ensuring the effectiveness of the risk response. It is important to identify and plan for both known and potential risks, as well as secondary risks that may arise as a result of implementing the risk responses. The plan for risk responses should be approved and integrated into the project management plan, and organizational project management rules should be followed, including project change management, configuration control, project planning, budgeting, scheduling, resource management, project communication planning, and critical success factors.","Relations:

These responses are made by the project team, who create a response plan that will be executed under predefined conditions or with sufficient warning. The plan takes into account identified risks and uses a technique called contingency planning to include fallback plans for identified triggering events. Early identification of risks is crucial in the project lifecycle, as it allows for key project decisions to be made with the maximum consideration of inherent risks. This early identification also maximizes the time available for the development and implementation of risk responses, making them more efficient and less costly overall.","Relations:

This analysis involves quantifying the monetary impact of individual project risks and comparing it to the implementation cost of the response strategy. The response strategy with a higher ratio indicates it is more effective. The selection process takes into account the cost of the responses and their impact on project objectives and considers the uncertainty of outcomes and potential secondary residual risks.

The project schedule and team assignments may also be updated to incorporate agreed-upon risk responses. The risk register and risk report may be updated to reflect chosen response strategies, trigger conditions, and contingency plans. It is important to ensure that agreed-upon risk responses are actually executed, as common problems in project risk management include not giving adequate attention to implementing risk responses. The plan risk responses process aims to determine the actions that will enhance the chances of project success while complying with organizational and project constraints. It involves prioritizing risks, developing plans to address each risk, and assigning responsibilities for monitoring and implementing risk responses. The role of the risk owner and risk action owner is to ensure that risk responses are effective and executed as planned. There may also be residual risks that remain even after response actions are implemented. The plan risk responses process should be integrated into the project management plan and should follow the applicable organizational project management rules. This includes invoking project change management, configuration control, project planning, budgeting and scheduling, resource management, and project communication planning.","Relations:

exposure of the project and individual threats and opportunities be managed proactively.","Implement Risk Responses is a process that ensures agreed-upon risk response plans are executed, reducing project risk exposure and maximizing opportunities.

These documents include an issue log, a risk register, and a lessons learned register. 

The issue log is used to track and update open issues that may require action or resolution. 

The risk register identifies individual project risks, their owners, and agreed-upon responses. It may also include implementation details and control actions. 

The risk report provides an assessment of the project's current risk exposure and a strategy for response. It also describes major risks and their planned responses. 

The qualitative risk analysis process categorizes risks based on their probability and potential impact on project objectives. Risks are assigned priorities and the risk register is updated with this information. High priority risks are closely monitored and response plans are regularly reviewed and adjusted. Low priority risks may be placed on a watch list and reviewed less frequently.","Relations:
