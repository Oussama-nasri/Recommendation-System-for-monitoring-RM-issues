0,1,CHAPTER 1  -  INTRODUCTION,1.1 ,1.1 Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management,"['1.1 Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management The purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management is to ( a ) provide a standard for project management practitioners and other stakeholders that deﬁ nes the aspects of Project Risk Management that are recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time and ( b ) provide a standard that is globally applicable and consistently applied. This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes. The Practice Standard for Project Risk Management covers risk management as it is applied to single projects only. Like the PMBOK ® Guide – Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs or portfolios of projects. Chapter 11 of the PMBOK ® Guide – Fourth Edition, is the basis for the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards. Figure 1-1 compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the PMBOK ® Guide – Fourth Edition and textbooks, handbooks, and courses. Figure 1-1. Hierarchy of PMI Project Risk Management Resources31 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION This practice standard is organized in three main sections: 1. Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to Project Risk Management processes as deﬁ ned in the PMBOK ® Guide – Fourth Edition. 2. Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the PMBOK ® Guide – Fourth Edition. The six processes are as follows: Plan Risk Management, • Identify Risks, • Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, • Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, • Plan Risk Responses, and • Monitor and Control Risks. • Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics: ( a ) purpose and objectives of the process; ( b ) critical success factors for the process; ( c ) tools and techniques for the process; and ( d ) documenting the results of the process. 3. A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive, and successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for several reasons: 1. Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and techniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. 2. Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk Management. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to apply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. 3. The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, reﬂ ecting the many business and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures between commercial and national companies, government and non-government organizations, and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization’s processes. Practitioners can establish processes speciﬁ c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice.41 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION 1.2 Project Risk Management Deﬁ nition']","['Figure 1-1', 'Figure 1-1']"

Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide action-oriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may or may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to other dimensions such as their impact on objectives. 1.3 Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management']",[]
2,1,CHAPTER 1  -  INTRODUCTION,1.3 ,1.3 Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management,"['1.3 Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management Project Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management. It should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In this way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every process group. Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to ﬁ nal design and from procurement through daily management of execution and close-out. These processes often assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of project risks. Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it builds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project. Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary, Project Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and change management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of conﬁ dence for meeting project objectives.51 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project, the level of risk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not mean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project’s life cycle. The earlier in the project life cycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project ﬂ exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop. It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in place, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. During project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future. Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management practice. 1.4 Good Risk Management Practice']",[]
3,1,CHAPTER 1  -  INTRODUCTION,1.4 ,1.4 Good Risk Management Practice,"['1.4 Good Risk Management Practice Project Risk Management is a valuable component of project management and it enhances the value of the other project management processes. As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other processes involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is appropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the multi-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture projects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe. Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may require decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets, make commitments to others outside the project, interact with regulators, and comply with the rules of accounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and external requirements.61 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project Management code of ethics or conduct. Honesty, responsibility, realism, professionalism and fair dealing with others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management. Effective Project Risk Management beneﬁ ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement among stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identiﬁ cation, analysis, and response, in particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other unreasonable inﬂ uences. Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of tools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the characteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, short-term, internal project that can be conducted in the background with a ﬂ exible deadline. Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under management during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions made in that process remain appropriate. 1.5 Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management']",[]

Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management71 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION Speciﬁ c criteria for success of each Project Risk Management process are listed in the chapters dealing with those processes. The general criteria for success include: • Recognize the Value of Risk Management — Project Risk Management should be recognized as a valuable discipline that provides a positive potential return on investment for organizational management, project stakeholders (both internal and external), project management, and team members. • Individual Commitment/Responsibility — Project participants and stakeholders should all accept responsibility for undertaking risk-related activities as required. Risk management is everybody’s responsibility. • Open and Honest Communication — Everyone should be involved in the Project Risk Management process. Any actions or attitudes that hinder communication about project risk reduce the effectiveness of Project Risk Management in terms of proactive approaches and effective decision-making. • Organizational Commitment — Organizational commitment can only be established if risk management is aligned with the organization’s goals and values. Project Risk Management may require a higher level of managerial support than other project management disciplines because handling some of the risks will require approval of or responses from others at levels above the project manager. • Risk Effort Scaled to Project — Project Risk Management activities should be consistent with the value of the project to the organization and with its level of project risk, its scale, and other organizational constraints. In particular, the cost of Project Risk Management should be appropriate to its potential value to the project and the organization. • Integration with Project Management — Project Risk Management does not exist in a vacuum, isolated from other project management processes. Successful Project Risk Management requires the correct execution of the other project management processes. These critical success factors for Project Risk Management are illustrated in Figure 1-2. 1.6 Conclusion']","['Figure 1-2', 'Figure 1-2']"

6,2,CHAPTER 2  -  PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS,2.1 ,2.1 Introduction,['2.1 Introduction This chapter introduces the key ideas required to understand and apply Project Risk Management to projects following the approach described in Chapter 11 of the PMBOK ® Guide – Fourth Edition. These principles and concepts are generally consistent with other approaches to Project Risk Management commonly used although the terminology may differ in some details. The execution of the Project Risk Management process is dealt with in subsequent chapters of this practice standard and so is not discussed here. 2.2 Deﬁ nition of Project Risk'],[]
7,2,CHAPTER 2  -  PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS,2.2 ,2.2 Deﬁ nition of Project Risk,"['2.2 Deﬁ nition of Project Risk The word “risk” is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines. Its use in the PMBOK ® Guide – Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process descriptions. The deﬁ nition of project risk given in the PMBOK ® Guide – Fourth Edition is as follows: Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative effect on a project’s objectives. This deﬁ nition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a project’s objectives. When assessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty dimension may be described using the term “probability” and the effect may be called “impact” (though other descriptors are possible, such as “likelihood” and “consequence”). The deﬁ nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and more general conditions which are less speciﬁ c but also may give risk to uncertainty. The deﬁ nition of project risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a project’s objectives, as well as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called, respectively, threats and opportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a uniﬁ ed Project Risk Management process. This allows for the gain of synergies and efﬁ ciencies such as addressing both in the same analyses and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other.102 CHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur, but which would matter if they did occur. It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features, such as cause and effect. Causes are events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise to risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project objectives if the associated risk occurs. The cause-risk-effect chain can be used in a structured risk statement or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described (see Section 5.3). When a risk event occurs, it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or problems; opportunities which occur may be called beneﬁ ts. Both issues/problems and beneﬁ ts entail project management actions that are outside the scope of the Project Risk Management process. 2.3 Individual Risks and Overall Project Risk']",[]
8,2,CHAPTER 2  -  PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS,2.3 ,2.3 Individual Risks and Overall Project Risk,"['2.3 Individual Risks and Overall Project Risk It is useful to consider project risk at two levels: individual risks and overall project risk. Individual risks are speciﬁ c events or conditions that might affect project objectives. An individual risk may positively or negatively affect one or more of the project objectives, elements, or tasks. Understanding individual risks can assist in determining how to apply effort and resources to enhance the chances of project success. Day-to-day Project Risk Management focuses on these individual risks in order to enhance the prospects of a successful project outcome. Overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall project risk is more than the sum of individual risks on a project, since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual elements or tasks. It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome. It is an important component of strategic decision-making, program and portfolio management, and project governance where investments are sanctioned or cancelled and priorities are set. At these higher levels, it is necessary to set realistic targets for the cost and duration of a project, establish the contingency reserve levels required to protect the project stakeholders, set appropriate project priorities, and judge whether the risk of overall success is increasing or decreasing as implementation advances. 2.4 Stakeholder Risk Attitudes']",[]
9,2,CHAPTER 2  -  PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS,2.4 ,2.4 Stakeholder Risk Attitudes,"['2.4 Stakeholder Risk Attitudes The risk attitudes of the project stakeholders determine the extent to which an individual risk or overall project risk matters. A wide range of factors inﬂ uence risk attitude. These include the scale of the project within the range of stakeholders’ overall activities, the strength of public commitments made about the performance of the project, and the stakeholders’ sensitivity to issues such as environmental impacts, industrial relations, and other factors. Stakeholder risk attitudes usually result in a desire for increased certainty in project outcomes, and may express a preference for one project objective over another. How risk is regarded is usually also strongly inﬂ uenced by an organization’s culture. Different organizations are more or less open, and this often impacts the way risk management can be applied.112 CHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS Understanding stakeholders’ attitudes toward risk is an important component of risk management planning that precedes risk identiﬁ cation and analysis, in order to optimize both project success and stakeholder satisfaction with the project’s results. These attitudes should be identiﬁ ed and managed proactively and deliberately throughout the Project Risk Management process. They may differ from one project to another for the same stakeholders and will usually differ from one group of stakeholders to another. In fact a single stakeholder may adopt different risk attitudes at various stages in the same project. It is also important to understand the particular implications of stakeholder risk attitudes on projects where the team is international, cross-industry, or multi-organizational. 2.5 Iterative Process']",[]
10,2,CHAPTER 2  -  PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS,2.5 ,2.5 Iterative Process,"['2.5 Iterative Process It is the nature of projects that circumstances change as they are being planned and executed. The amount of information available about risks will usually increase as time goes on. Some risks will occur while others will not, new risks will arise or be discovered, and the characteristics of those already identiﬁ ed may change. As a result, the Project Risk Management processes should be repeated and the corresponding plans progressively elaborated throughout the lifetime of the project. To ensure that Project Risk Management remains effective, the identiﬁ cation and analysis of risks should be revisited periodically, the progress on risk response actions should be monitored, and the action plans adjusted accordingly. If external circumstances change signiﬁ cantly, it may also be necessary to revisit the risk management planning process. The development of an initial risk management plan and risk assessment is the start of the process, not the end. The frequency and depth of reviews and updates will depend on the nature of the project, the volatility of the environment in which the project is being implemented, and the timing of other project management reviews and updates. 2.6 Communication']",[]
11,2,CHAPTER 2  -  PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS,2.6 ,2.6 Communication,['2.6 Communication Project Risk Management cannot take place in isolation. Success relies heavily on communication throughout the process. Risk identiﬁ cation and analysis depend on comprehensive input from stakeholders in a project to ensure that nothing signiﬁ cant is overlooked and that risks are realistically assessed. The credibility of the process and the commitment of those who should act to manage risks can be assured only if the way the process operates and the conclusions it produces are understood and seen as credible by all concerned. This demands effective and honest communication from the Project Risk Management process to the rest of the project team and other project stakeholders. Communication of the results of the Project Risk Management process should be targeted to meet the speciﬁ c needs of each stakeholder and should be reﬂ ected within the overall project communications strategy with each stakeholder’s responsibility and role in risk management identiﬁ ed and agreed-upon.122 CHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS 2.7 Responsibility for Project Risk Management'],[]

However it is important that management of project risk is not left to a few risk specialists. Project Risk Management should be included as an integral part of all other project processes. Since project risks can affect project objectives, anyone with an interest in achieving those objectives should play a role in Project Risk Management. The speciﬁ c roles depend on the project team members’ and other stakeholders’ place within the project and their relation to project objectives. Roles and responsibilities for Project Risk Management should be clearly deﬁ ned and communicated, and individuals should be held responsible and accountable for results. This includes allocating responsibility for speciﬁ c activities within the risk process, as well as for resulting actions required to implement agreed-upon responses. Responsibility should also be allocated for ensuring that risk-related lessons are captured for future use. 2.8 Project Manager’s Role for Project Risk Management']",[]

14,3,CHAPTER 3  -  INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES,3.1 ,3.1 Project Risk Management and Project Management,"['3.1 Project Risk Management and Project Management All projects are uncertain. Uncertainty is inevitable since projects are unique and temporary undertakings based on assumptions and constraints, delivering project results to multiple stakeholders with different requirements. Project management can be seen as an attempt to control this uncertain environment, through the use of structured and disciplined techniques such as estimating, planning, cost control, task allocation, earned value analysis, monitoring and review meetings, etc. Each of these elements of project management has a role in deﬁ ning or controlling the uncertainty which is inherent in all projects. Project Risk Management provides an approach by which uncertainty can be understood, assessed, and managed within projects. As such it forms an integral part of project management, and effective Project Risk Management is a critical success factor for project success. For project management to be fully effective, however, it is important that Project Risk Management is not viewed as an optional process or performed as an additional overhead task. Since many elements of project management address inherent uncertainty, the interface between structured Project Risk Management and the other processes of project management needs to be clear. The outputs of Project Risk Management should be taken into account within many of the project management processes. They can, for example, impact: Estimating resource requirements, cost, or duration; • Assessing the impact of proposed scope changes; • Planning or re-planning the forward strategy of the project; • Allocating resources to tasks; and • Reporting progress to stakeholders. • None of these actions can be performed properly without a clear view of the risk involved, as determined during the Project Risk Management process. In other words, project management process effectiveness is increased by using the information and results from Project Risk Management. In addition, effective Project Risk Management requires input from other project management processes. Outputs such as the work breakdown structure (WBS), estimates, the project schedule, assumptions list, etc. are all important prerequisites for effective Project Risk Management.143 CHAPTER 3 − INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES 3.2 Project Risk Management Processes']",[]
15,3,CHAPTER 3  -  INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES,3.2 ,3.2 Project Risk Management Processes,"['3.2 Project Risk Management Processes The deﬁ ned steps of Project Risk Management describe a structured approach for understanding and managing risk on a project. This chapter outlines the steps required for effective Project Risk Management. Each step is described in more detail in subsequent chapters. As previously deﬁ ned, project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives. From this deﬁ nition, it is clear that risks only exist in relation to objectives. It is therefore essential at the start of the Project Risk Management process to clearly deﬁ ne the objectives. It is also clear that different projects are exposed to different levels of risk, so each step in the Project Risk Management process should be scalable to meet the varying degrees of risk. Scalable elements of the process include: Available resources, • Methodology and processes used, • Tools and techniques used, • Supporting infrastructure, • Review and update frequency, and • Reporting requirements. • As a precondition for a successful Project Risk Management implementation, it is important to have a clear understanding of the risk thresholds that deﬁ ne the key stakeholders’ views on acceptable levels of risk, as well as a framework against which identiﬁ ed risks can be assessed. As a result, the Project Risk Management process always starts with an initiation step. This is required in order to ensure a common understanding and agreement of the team and other stakeholders on the approach and parameters that will be applied in managing risk in this project, as well as the scope and objectives of the Project Risk Management process itself. Project Risk Management activities, resources, and attention should be appropriate to the project since different projects warrant different levels of risk management application. The main actions to provide the required tailoring are as follows: Deﬁ ne those objectives against which risks will be identiﬁ ed, • Deﬁ ne how the elements of the Project Risk Management process will be scaled for this • project, and Deﬁ ne risk thresholds, tolerances, and the assessment framework. • The outputs from this initial step should be documented, communicated, and then reviewed by the stakeholders to ensure a common understanding of the scope and objectives for the Project Risk Management process. The document should be formally approved at a senior level.153 CHAPTER']",[]
16,4,CHAPTER 4  -  PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT,4.1 ,4.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Plan Risk Management Process,"['4.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Plan Risk Management Process The objectives of the Plan Risk Management process are to develop the overall risk management strategy for the project, to decide how the risk management processes will be executed, and to integrate Project Risk Management with all other project management activities. Effective risk management requires creation of a risk management plan. This plan describes how the risk management processes should be carried out and how they ﬁ t in with the other project management processes. On a broader level, it describes the relationships among Project Risk Management, general project management, and the management processes in the rest of the organization. To provide the greatest beneﬁ t, initial risk management planning should be carried out early in the overall planning of the project, and the corresponding risk management activities integrated into the overall project management plan. The risk management plan may subsequently need to be adapted as the needs of the project and its stakeholders become clearer or change. Although the Project Risk Management processes form an integral part of the overall project management plan, a budget in terms of resources, cost, and time for the speciﬁ c risk management activities should be established in order to better track, control, and, as necessary, defend the corresponding expenditures throughout the project. The cost of treating the risks themselves should be included appropriately in the project budget, while the risk management plan should describe how this part of the project budget is evaluated, allocated, and managed. The risk management plan will deﬁ ne the monitoring methods to ensure that the corresponding expenditures are tracked appropriately, as well as the conditions under which the approved budget for risk management can be modiﬁ ed. In the same way that project management is a process of progressive elaboration, risk management activities need to be repeated throughout the project. The risk management plan should deﬁ ne both the normal frequency for repeating the processes as well as speciﬁ c or exceptional conditions under which the corresponding actions should be initiated. The corresponding risk management activities should be integrated into the project management plan. There are two categories of success criteria for risk management: those for success of the project in general, and those for success of Project Risk Management.204CHAPTER 4 − PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT • Project-Related Criteria. To assess the success of Project Risk Management, the stakeholders must agree on an acceptable level of results for the project-related criteria (such as cost, time, and scope). In order to ensure consistency and agreement among stakeholders, the risk management plan should present these objectives with reference to the project deﬁ nition documents. To provide guidance in risk management, particularly in prioritizing risk responses, stakeholders should also prioritize each project objective. • Process-Related Criteria. The measures for success in Project Risk Management depend on a number of factors, such as the inherent level of uncertainty of the project. For example, the Project Risk Management process for a research project needs to address more unforeseen changes than for a project with a more predictable environment. A research Project Risk Management process may be considered a success even if it results in more variance from the baseline than would be allowable for a successful process in a more predictable project. The level of risk that is considered acceptable in a project depends on the risk attitudes of the relevant stakeholders. The risk attitudes of both the organization and the stakeholders may be inﬂ uenced by a number of factors, all of which need to be identiﬁ ed. These include their inherent tolerance for uncertainty, and the relative importance to them of achieving or missing speciﬁ c project objectives. The output of this analysis should then be taken into account for setting thresholds and providing weighting factors when applying the Project Risk Management processes in the speciﬁ c project. Guidelines and rules for escalating risk-related information to management and other stakeholders should reﬂ ect the risk attitudes and expectations of the corresponding stakeholders. The project manager should maintain effective communication with the stakeholders as the project evolves, in order to become aware of any changes in the stakeholders’ attitudes and adapt the risk management approach to take any new facts into account. It is important that the participants share a common understanding of all terms used to describe the risks, and that the critical values and thresholds that will serve as parameters for the tools should be deﬁ ned in a manner consistent with the scope of the project and the attitudes of the stakeholders. If qualitative analysis uses such terms as “high impact” or “medium probability,” these should be deﬁ ned objectively in the risk management plan. Similarly, the risk management plan should specify any key numerical values required in quantitative analysis or for decision-making in risk response planning or risk monitoring and control. Risk management planning should establish the type and level of risk detail to be addressed and provide a template of the risk register that will be used for recording risk-related information. The risk management plan should also indicate the intensity of effort and the frequency with which the various Project Risk Management processes should be applied; this depends on the characteristics of the project as well as on the speciﬁ ed risk management objectives. In order for the Project Risk Management processes to be carried out correctly and effectively, the project team and other stakeholders need to know where and when they will be expected to participate, their criteria for determining success, their level of authority, and what action to take relative to actions or decisions beyond this level. The risk management plan speciﬁ es the project’s risk management roles and responsibilities and deﬁ nes the corresponding expectations for both senior management and project personnel.214 CHAPTER 4 − PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT Risk-related communication occurs at two levels: (a) within the project team, and (b) between the project team and the other project stakeholders. The principles for each of these categories of communication are deﬁ ned in the risk management plan. For the team, the plan describes the frequency and scope of the various risk management meetings and reports required to carry out the corresponding Project Risk Management processes as well as the structure and content of such meetings and reports. For the other stakeholders, the plan sets their expectations as to the structure, content, and frequency of routine documents to be received as well as the way in which information will be shared for escalation or exceptional events. Details of the information required by the project team from stakeholders should also be clearly deﬁ ned. 4.2 Critical Success Factors for the Plan Risk Management Process']",[]

A clear deﬁ nition of the project objectives and a high-level view of the project environment and solution approach are required to provide a valid basis for risk management. The project manager should therefore ensure that valid deﬁ nition and planning information is available for the plan risk management activity. An organization inexperienced in risk management planning may need to develop its own approach and may expend an inappropriate amount of time and effort on this. Alternatively it may use a proprietary or pre-existing approach which requires tailoring. The availability of some or all of the following organizational process assets contributes to the chances of success of the Plan Risk Management activities: standard templates, predeﬁ ned risk categories, and an established project management methodology incorporating risk management procedures that specify what risk information is required for decision making, when it is required, and a deﬁ nition of concepts and terms, roles, responsibilities, and authority levels. Access to relevant lessons learned at this stage will allow this experience to be taken into account from the start of the project. The risk management plan will not deliver its value unless Project Risk Management is carried out as an integral part of the project. The corresponding activities should be built into the project work breakdown structure and included in the corresponding schedule, budget, and work-assignment documents.224 CHAPTER 4 − PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT 4.2.2 Involve Project Stakeholders in Project Risk Management']",[]

Consequently, after risk management planning has been completed, the ﬁ rst process in the iterative Project Risk Management process aims to identify all the knowable risks to project objectives. It is, however, impossible to identify all the risks at the outset of a project. Over time, the level of project risk exposure changes as a result of the decisions and actions taken previously in the project (internal change) and of externally imposed change. The purpose of risk identiﬁ cation is to identify risks to the maximum extent that is practicable. The fact that some risks are unknowable or emergent requires the Identify Risk process to be iterative, repeating the Identify Risks process to ﬁ nd new risks which have become knowable since the previous iteration of the process. When a risk is ﬁ rst identiﬁ ed, potential responses may also be identiﬁ ed at the same time. These should be recorded during the Identify Risks process and considered for immediate action if such action is appropriate.

The outcomes or effectiveness of these techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively. These techniques can be used either singly or in groups, and employ varying degrees of structure. These techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively, and their success is enhanced by use of a skilled facilitator. Each category of risk identiﬁ cation technique has strengths and weaknesses, and no single technique can be expected to reveal all knowable risks. Consequently, the Identify Risks process for a particular project should use a combination of techniques, perhaps selecting one from each category. For example, a project may choose to use a risk identiﬁ cation checklist (historical review), together with assumptions analysis (current assessment) and brainstorming (creativity). Use of a risk breakdown structure which organizes the categories of potential risks on the project, a prompt list, or a set of generic list categories may assist in ensuring that as many sources of risk as practicable have been addressed, while recognizing that no such tools are complete nor can they replace original thinking.295 CHAPTER 5 − IDENTIFY RISKS Whichever risk identiﬁ cation techniques are used, it is important that identiﬁ ed risks are unambiguously described in order to ensure that the project risk process is focused on the actual risks and not distracted or diluted by non-risks. Use of structured risk descriptions can ensure clarity. Risk meta-language offers a useful way of distinguishing a risk from its cause(s) and effect(s), describing each risk using three-part statements in the form: “As a result of cause, risk may occur, which would lead to effect.” The relationship between cause, risk, and effect is shown in Figure 5-2.

Assessing individual risks using qualitative risk analysis evaluates the probability that each risk will occur and the effect of each individual risk on the project objectives. As such it does not directly address the overall risk to project objectives that results from the combined effect of all risks and their potential interactions with each other. This can however be achieved through use of quantitative risk analysis techniques (see Chapter 7). One step in the analysis is to categorize risks according to their sources or causes. If several risks arise from a common source, sometimes called a root cause, risk responses may be more effective when they focus on addressing this root cause. Identifying common effects from groups of risks allows identiﬁ cation of the areas of greatest risk exposure (e.g. to the project completion date, the budget, or a particular deliverable’s scope), facilitating risk response focus in these areas. The methods of qualitative risk analysis are applied to the list of risks created or updated by the Identify Risks process to provide project management with the characteristics of the risks that have the most inﬂ uence (positive or negative) on achieving the project’s objectives. Risks that are assessed as high priority to either threaten or to enhance the achievement of project objectives will be an important focus in the Plan Risk Responses process.

Other factors may be considered in determining the importance of a risk as follows: • Urgency (proximity). Risks requiring near term responses may be considered more urgent to address. Indicators of urgency can include the lead time necessary to execute a risk response and the clarity of symptoms and warning signs (also known as detectability) that may trigger the response.

Understanding the relationships between risks may provide a better understanding of the possibility and magnitude of project risk than if risks are only considered as separate and independent events. Identifying common root causes of a group of risks, for instance, may reveal both the magnitude of the risk event for the group as a whole along with effective strategies that might address several risks simultaneously. Alternatively, some risks may be linked with others in a causal chain, and understanding the chain of risks may lead to a better understanding of the implication of risk for the project. Identifying risks that can occur at the same time or using the same resources for recovery might provide a realistic picture of problems of risk mitigation using scarce resources. Combining the results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process with the risk breakdown structure (see Identify Risks, Chapter 5) can show clusters of priority risks arising from speciﬁ c sources. A combination of the risk analysis information with the work breakdown structure (WBS) can show which areas of the project exhibit the most risk.

Results from this type of analysis can be used to evaluate the likelihood of success in achieving project objectives and to estimate contingency reserves, usually for time and cost that are appropriate to both the risks and the risk tolerance of project stakeholders. It is generally accepted that analyzing uncertainty in the project using quantitative techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation may provide more realism in the estimate of the overall project cost or schedule than a non-probabilistic approach which assumes that the activity durations or line-item cost estimates are deterministic. However it should be recognized that quantitative risk analysis is not always required or appropriate for all projects. For example, qualitative risk analysis may provide enough information for development of effective risk responses, especially for smaller projects. Therefore, during the Plan Risk Management process, the beneﬁ ts of quantitative risk analysis should be weighed against the effort required to ensure that the additional insights and value justify the additional effort. Partial risk analyses, such as qualitative risk analysis, aim at prioritizing individual risks viewed one at a time and therefore cannot produce measures of overall project risk when all risks are considered simultaneously. Calculating estimates of overall project risk is the focus of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process. Speciﬁ c project risks are usually best understood and quantiﬁ ed at a detailed level such as the line-item cost or schedule activity level. By contrast, project objectives such as achievement of the project’s budget or the schedule are speciﬁ ed at a higher level, often at the level of the total project. An overall risk analysis, such as one that uses quantitative techniques, estimates the implication of all quantiﬁ ed risks on project objectives. The implementation of overall risk analysis using quantitative methods requires: Complete and accurate representation of the project objectives built up from individual project • elements. Examples of these representations include the project schedule or cost estimate. Identifying risks on individual project elements such as schedule activities or line-item costs at a • level of detail that lends itself to speciﬁ c assessment of individual risks. Including generic risks that have a broader effect than individual project elements. • Applying a quantitative method (such as Monte Carlo simulation or decision tree analysis) that incorporates • multiple risks simultaneously in determining overall impact on the overall project objective.387 CHAPTER 7 − PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS Results of the quantitative analysis will be compared to the project plan (baseline or current) to give management an estimate of the overall project risk and will answer important questions such as: What is the probability of meeting the project’s objectives? • How much contingency reserve (e.g., reserves or buffers of time, resources, and cost) is needed to • provide the organization with the level of certainty it requires based upon its risk tolerance? What are those parts of the project, such as line-item costs or schedule activities, which contribute • the most risk when all risks are considered simultaneously? Which individual risks contribute the most to overall project risk? • Estimating overall project risk using quantitative methods helps distinguish those projects where quantiﬁ ed risks threaten objectives beyond the tolerance of the stakeholders, from those for which the objectives are within acceptable tolerances even when risk is considered. The former may be targeted for vigorous risk responses aimed at protecting those objectives most important to the stakeholders.

In each of these methods, the risks are speciﬁ ed at the level of the detailed tasks or line-item costs and incorporated into the model of the project to calculate effects on objectives such as schedule or cost for the entire project, by combining those risks.407 CHAPTER 7 − PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS 7.2.6 Interrelationships Between Risks in Quantitative Risk Analysis']",[]

Another common way to represent the risks which occur together is by using the risk register listing of the risk or root cause and attaching it to several project elements such as schedule activities or cost elements.

Once risks have been identiﬁ ed, analyzed, and prioritized, plans should be developed for addressing every risk the project team considers to be sufﬁ ciently important, either because of the threat it poses to the project objectives or the opportunity it offers. The planning entails agreeing upon the actions to be taken and the potential changes to budget, schedule, resources, and scope which these actions might cause. Contingent risk response actions need to be executed at the optimum time. For this reason, the response speciﬁ cation for each such risk should include a description of any corresponding trigger conditions. The responsibility for monitoring the project conditions and implementing the corresponding actions should be clearly assigned. Every risk should have been allocated to a risk owner as part of the Identify Risks process, and each of the corresponding risk responses should now be assigned to a speciﬁ c risk action owner. The risk owner is responsible for ensuring that the risk response is effective and for planning additional risk responses if required, whereas the risk action owner is responsible for ensuring that the agreed-upon risk responses are carried out as planned, in a timely manner. The role of the risk owner and that of the risk action owner may be assigned to a single person. Responses, when implemented, can have potential effects on the project objectives and, as such, can generate additional risks. These are known as secondary risks and have to be analyzed and planned for in the same way as those risks which were initially identiﬁ ed. It is never feasible or even desirable to eliminate all threats from a project. Similarly, there is also a limit to the extent to which opportunities can be proactively managed. There may be residual risks that will remain after the responses have been implemented. These residual risks should be clearly identiﬁ ed, analyzed, documented, and communicated to all relevant stakeholders.448 CHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES All the approved, unconditional actions arising from risk response planning should be integrated into the project management plan in order to ensure that they are carried out as part of normal project implementation.

Categorization of risks, for example by using tools such as the risk breakdown structure, afﬁ nity diagram, or other categorizing tools, may help identify and address this situation. There is also a need during the Plan Risk Responses process to consider the risks aggregated during the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process (e.g., ten small, related risks combined may pose a big risk to the project), and then to develop generic responses where possible. Another interaction effect that may occur is when one risk, if it occurs, may affect the probability or impact of other risks. Deciding on the response strategy may require a compromise, since some proposed responses may be mutually exclusive or counterproductive. For example mitigating a threat to time could cost money, thereby increasing pressure on the budget. Risk response planning also needs to take a holistic view of all proposed responses and make sure they are coherent.468 CHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES The challenge therefore in planning responses to risks is the need to control the potential effects of the strategy developed for treating the original risk.

In addition to tracking and managing the risk response actions, the effectiveness of all of the Project Risk Management processes should be reviewed to provide improvements to the management of the current project as well as future ones. For each risk or set of risks for which a contingent response has been deﬁ ned, the corresponding set of trigger conditions should have been speciﬁ ed. It is the responsibility of the action owner to ensure that these conditions are effectively monitored and that the corresponding actions are carried out as deﬁ ned, in a timely manner. Once the Plan Risk Responses process is complete, all of the approved unconditional response actions should have been included and deﬁ ned in the current project management plan. The ﬁ rst action of risk monitoring and controlling is to check whether this is the case and take any appropriate action if necessary, such as invoking the change management process with respect to any missing actions. This will then ensure that the agreed-upon actions are carried out within the normal project execution framework. The risk owners and risk action owners need to be briefed on any changes that may affect their responsibilities. Effective communication needs to be maintained between them and the project manager so that the designated stakeholders accept accountability for controlling the potential outcomes of speciﬁ c risks, apply their best efforts to track the associated trigger conditions and carry out the agreed-upon responses in a timely manner. In addition to the response actions and trigger conditions, a mechanism for measuring the effectiveness of the response is provided by the Plan Risk Responses process. The risk action owner should keep the risk owner aware of the status of the response actions so that the risk owner can decide when the risk has been effectively dealt with, or whether additional actions need to be planned and implemented.529 CHAPTER 9 − MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS As the project progresses, additional information becomes available and the project environment may change as some risks occur, whether foreseen or unforeseen, and others become or cease to be relevant. The planning should therefore be kept current and the project manager should ensure that periodic risk reassessment, including risk identiﬁ cation, analysis, and response planning, is repeated at reasonable intervals, or in response to project events—without generating excessive administrative overhead. Typical reasons for risk reassessment are: Occurrence of a major or unexpected risk, • Need to analyze a complex change request, • Phase end review, • Project re-planning or major plan elaboration, and • Periodic review to ensure that the information remains current. • In the event of major organizational changes, risk management planning may need to be revisited prior to reassessing the risks. In addition to the regular status reviews, periodic audits should be performed to determine strengths and weaknesses in handling risks within the project. This should entail identifying any barriers to effectiveness or keys to success in risk management, recognition of which could lead to improvements in risk management of the current or future projects. At the end of the project, an integrated analysis of the risk management process should be carried out with a focus on long-term process improvements. This analysis consolidates the ﬁ ndings of the periodic audits to identify lessons that would be applicable in general to a large proportion of the organization’s projects in the future, such as appropriate levels of resources, adequate time for the analysis, use of tools, level of detail, etc. At project closure, the project manager should ensure that a description has been given of the closure of every risk in the risk register, for example: (a) did not occur; (b) occurred and contingency plan invoked; or (c) occurred and impact to the project scope (i.e., time, cost, and quality). The output of the audit of the risk management process should be consolidated with speciﬁ c information with respect to the project’s experience of risks, and any generally applicable guidelines for the organization should be highlighted and potential actions proposed for applying them. This can lead to an update to the corresponding organizational process assets.

Stakeholders’ perception of the effectiveness of risk management is conditioned in part by the way in which risks are handled as they occur, and by the number or characteristics of such events. It is therefore crucial, whenever a risk occurs, that information about the event, as well as the progress and effectiveness of the responses, be communicated at regular intervals and in an honest manner adapted to the needs of each stakeholder. This should be supported by a well-executed communications plan. 9.3 Tools and Techniques for the Monitor and Control Risks Process']",[]

Techniques are required that allow the project manager to assess at any point in the project whether these provide the required level of conﬁ dence in the success of the project. Tools for managing time buffers should be closely integrated into the project’s scheduling techniques, whereas those for managing cost should be compatible with the ﬁ nancial practices. Tools are required to identify trends and forecast future outcomes to determine whether the reserves will remain sufﬁ cient. Tools are also required for tracking progress and spending in a consolidated manner.559 CHAPTER 9 − MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS 9.3.2 Tracking Trigger Conditions']",[]
