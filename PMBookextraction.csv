11.1.3.1 RISK MANAGEM ENT PLAN
The risk management plan is a component of the project management plan that describes how risk management 
activities will be structured and performed. The risk management plan may include some or all of the following elements:
uuRisk strategy. Describes the general approach to managing risk on this project.
uuMethodology. Deﬁnes the speciﬁc approaches, tools, and data sources that will be used to perform risk 
management on the project.
uuRoles and responsibilities. Deﬁnes the lead, support, and risk management team members for each type of activity described in the risk management plan, and clariﬁes their responsibilities.
uuFunding. Identiﬁes the funds needed to perform activities related to Project Risk Management. Establishes 
protocols for the application of contingency and management reserves.
uuTiming. Deﬁnes when and how often the Project Risk Management processes will be performed throughout the project life cycle, and establishes risk management activities for inclusion into the project schedule.
uuRisk categories. Provide a means for grouping individual project risks. A common way to structure risk categories is with a risk breakdown structure (RBS), which is a hierarchical representation of potential sources of risk (see example in 407uuStakeholder risk appetite. The risk appetites of key stakeholders on the project are recorded in the risk 
management plan, as they inform the details of the Plan Risk Management process. In particular, stakeholder risk 
appetite should be expressed as measurable risk thresholds around each project objective. These thresholds will determine the acceptable level of overall project risk exposure, and they are also used to inform the deﬁnitions of probability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing individual project risks.
uuDefinitions of risk probability and impacts. Deﬁnitions of risk probability and impact levels are speciﬁc to the project context and reﬂect the risk appetite and thresholds of the organization and key stakeholders. The project may generate speciﬁc deﬁnitions of probability and impact levels or it may start with general deﬁnitions provided by the organization. The number of levels reﬂects the degree of detail required for the Project Risk Management process, with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach (typically ﬁve levels), and fewer for a simple process (usually three). 

ange408 Part 1 - GuideuuProbability and impact matrix. Described in Section . Prioritization rules may be speciﬁed by the 
organization in advance of the project and be included in organizational process assets, or they may be tailored to the speciﬁc project. Opportunities and threats are represented in a common probability and impact matrix using positive deﬁnitions of impact for opportunities and negative impact deﬁnitions for threats. Descriptive terms (such as very high, high, medium, low, and very low) or numeric values can be used for probability and impact. Where numeric values are used, these can be multiplied to give a probability-impact score for each risk, which allows the relative priority of individual risks to be evaluated within each priority level. An example probability and impact matrix is presented in 

uuReporting formats. Reporting formats deﬁne how the outcomes of the Project Risk Management process will be documented, analyzed, and communicated. This section of the risk management plan describes the content and format of the risk register and the risk report, as well as any other required outputs from the Project Risk Management processes.
uuTracking. Tracking documents how risk activities will be recorded and how risk management processes will 
be audited.
411Identify Risks considers both individual project risks and sources of overall project risk. Participants in risk 
identiﬁcation activities may include the following: project manager, project team members, project risk specialist 
(if assigned), customers, subject matter experts from outside the project team, end users, other project managers, operations managers, stakeholders, and risk management experts within the organization. While these personnel are often key participants for risk identiﬁcation, all project stakeholders should be encouraged to identify individual project risks. It is particularly important to involve the project team so they can develop and maintain a sense of ownership and responsibility for identiﬁed individual project risks, the level of overall project risk, and associated risk response actions.
When describing and recording individual project risks, a consistent format should be used for risk statements to 
ensure that each risk is understood clearly and unambiguously in order to support effective analysis and risk response development. Risk owners for individual project risks may be nominated as part of the Identify Risks process, and will be conﬁrmed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. Preliminary risk responses may also be identiﬁed and recorded and will be reviewed and conﬁrmed as part of the Plan Risk Responses process.
Identify Risks is an iterative process, since new individual project risks may emerge as the project progresses through 
its life cycle and the level of overall project risk will also change. The frequency of iteration and participation in each risk identiﬁcation cycle will vary by situation, and this will be deﬁned in the risk management plan.

Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
uuBrainstorming. The goal of brainstorming (see Section 4.1.2.2) is to obtain a comprehensive list of individual 
project risks and sources of overall project risk. The project team usually performs brainstorming, often with a multidisciplinary set of experts who are not part of the team. Ideas are generated under the guidance of a facilitator, either in a free-form brainstorm session or one that uses more structured techniques. Categories of risk, such as in a risk breakdown structure, can be used as a framework. Particular attention should be paid to ensuring that risks identiﬁed through brainstorming are clearly described, since the technique can result in ideas that are not fully formed.
uuChecklists. A checklist is a list of items, actions, or points to be considered. It is often used as a reminder. Risk checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been accumulated from similar projects and from other sources of information. They are an effective way to capture lessons learned from similar completed projects, listing speciﬁc individual project risks that have occurred previously and that may be relevant to this project. The organization may maintain a risk checklist based on its own completed projects or may use generic risk checklists from the industry. While a checklist may be quick and simple to use, it is impossible to build an exhaustive one, and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid the effort of proper risk identiﬁcation. The project team should also explore items that do not appear on the checklist. Additionally, the checklist should be reviewed from time to time to update new information as well as remove or archive obsolete information.
uuInterviews. Individual project risks and sources of overall project risk can be identiﬁed by interviewing experienced project participants, stakeholders, and subject matter experts. Interviews (see Section 5.2.2.2) should be conducted in an environment of trust and conﬁdentiality to encourage honest and unbiased contributions.41511.2.2.3","['Section 4.1.2.2)', 'Section 5.2.2.2)']"

Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
uuRoot cause analysis. Root cause analysis (see Section 8.2.2.2) is typically used to discover the underlying 
causes that lead to a problem, and develop preventive action. It can be used to identify threats by starting with a problem statement (for example, the project might be delayed or over budget) and exploring which threats might result in that problem occurring. The same technique can be used to ﬁnd opportunities by starting with a beneﬁt statement (for example, early delivery or under budget) and exploring which opportunities might result in that beneﬁt being realized.
uuAssumption and constraint analysis. Every project and its project management plan are conceived and developed based on a set of assumptions and within a series of constraints. These are often already incorporated in the scope baseline and project estimates. Assumption and constraint analysis explores the validity of assumptions and constraints to determine which pose a risk to the project. Threats may be identiﬁed from the inaccuracy, instability, inconsistency, or incompleteness of assumptions. Constraints may give rise to opportunities through removing or relaxing a limiting factor that affects the execution of a project or process.
uuSWOT analysis. This technique examines the project from each of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) perspectives. For risk identiﬁcation, it is used to increase the breadth of identiﬁed risks by including internally generated risks. The technique starts with the identiﬁcation of strengths and weaknesses of the organization, focusing on either the project, organization, or the business area in general. SWOT analysis then identiﬁes any opportunities for the project that may arise from strengths, and any threats resulting from weaknesses. The analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths may offset threats and determines if weaknesses might hinder opportunities.
uuDocument analysis. Described in Section 5.2.2.3. Risks may be identiﬁed from a structured review of project documents, including, but not limited to, plans, assumptions, constraints, previous project ﬁles, contracts, agreements, and technical documentation. Uncertainty or ambiguity in project documents, as well as inconsistencies within a document or between different documents, may be indicators of risk on the project.416 Part 1 - Guide11.2.2.4","['Section 8.2.2.2)', 'Section 5.2.2.3.']"

Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to facilitation (see Section 
4.1.2.3). Facilitation improves the effectiveness of many of the techniques used to identify individual project risks and 
sources of overall project risk.

A prompt list is a predetermined list of risk categories that might give rise to individual project risks and that could also 
act as sources of overall project risk. The prompt list can be used as a framework to aid the project team in idea generation 
when using risk identiﬁcation techniques. The risk categories in the lowest level of the risk breakdown structure can be used as a prompt list for individual project risks. Some common strategic frameworks are more suitable for identifying sources of overall project risk, for example PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal, environmental), TECOP (technical, environmental, commercial, operational, political), or VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity).

To undertake risk identiﬁcation, the project team may conduct a specialized meeting (often called a risk workshop). 
Most risk workshops include some form of brainstorming (see Section 4.1.2.2), but other risk identiﬁcation techniques 
may be included depending on the level of the risk process deﬁned in the risk management plan. Use of a skilled facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting. It is also essential to ensure that the right people participate in the risk workshop. On larger projects, it may be appropriate to invite the project sponsor, subject matter experts, sellers, representatives of the customer, or other project stakeholders.

On completion of the Identify Risks process, the content of the risk register may include but is not limited to:
uuList of identified risks. Each individual project risk is given a unique identiﬁer in the risk register. Identiﬁed risks are described in as much detail as required to ensure unambiguous understanding. A structured risk statement may be used to distinguish risks from their cause(s) and their effect(s).

uuList of potential risk responses. Where a potential risk response has been identiﬁed during the Identify Risks process, it is recorded in the risk register. This will be conﬁrmed during the Plan Risk Responses process.
Additional data may be recorded for each identiﬁed risk, depending on the risk register format speciﬁed in the risk 
management plan. This may include: a short risk title, risk category, current risk status, one or more causes, one or more effects on objectives, risk triggers (events or conditions that indicate that a risk is about to occur), WBS reference of affected activities, and timing information (when was the risk identiﬁed, when might the risk occur, when might it no longer be relevant, and what is the deadline for taking action).418 Part 1 - Guide11.2.3.2",[]

It identiﬁes a risk owner for each risk who will take responsibility for planning an appropriate risk response and ensuring 
that it is implemented. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis also lays the foundation for Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis if this process is required.
The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process is performed regularly throughout the project life cycle, as deﬁned in 
the risk management plan. Often, in an agile development environment, the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process is conducted before the start of each iteration.

Data analysis techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to:
uuRisk data quality assessment. Risk data quality assessment evaluates the degree to which the data about 
individual project risks is accurate and reliable as a basis for qualitative risk analysis. The use of low-quality risk data may lead to a qualitative risk analysis that is of little use to the project. If data quality is unacceptable, it may be necessary to gather better data. Risk data quality may be assessed via a questionnaire measuring the project’s stakeholder perceptions of various characteristics, which may include completeness, objectivity, relevancy, and timeliness. A weighted average of selected data quality characteristics can then be generated to give an overall quality score.
uuRisk probability and impact assessment. Risk probability assessment considers the likelihood that a speciﬁc risk will occur. Risk impact assessment considers the potential effect on one or more project objectives such as schedule, cost, quality, or performance. Impacts will be negative for threats and positive for opportunities. Probability and impact are assessed for each identiﬁed individual project risk. Risks can be assessed in interviews or meetings with participants selected for their familiarity with the types of risk recorded in the risk register. Project team members and knowledgeable persons external to the project are included. The level of probability for each risk and its impact on each objective are evaluated during the interview or meeting. Differences in the levels of probability and impact perceived by stakeholders are to be expected, and such differences should be explored. Explanatory detail, including assumptions justifying the levels assigned, are also recorded. Risk probabilities and impacts are assessed using the deﬁnitions given in the risk management plan (see Table 11-1). Risks with low probability and impact may be included within the risk register as part of a watch list for future monitoring.
uuAssessment of other risk parameters. The project team may consider other characteristics of risk (in addition to probability and impact) when prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis and action. These characteristics may include but are not limited to:424 Part 1 - Guideu nUrgency. The period of time within which a response to the risk is to be implemented in order to be effective. 
A short period indicates high urgency.
u nProximity. The period of time before the risk might have an impact on one or more project objectives. A short 
period indicates high proximity.
u nDormancy. The period of time that may elapse after a risk has occurred before its impact is discovered. A 
short period indicates low dormancy.
u nManageability. The ease with which the risk owner (or owning organization) can manage the occurrence or 
impact of a risk. Where management is easy, manageability is high.
u nControllability. The degree to which the risk owner (or owning organization) is able to control the risk’s 
outcome. Where the outcome can be easily controlled, controllability is high.
u nDetectability. The ease with which the results of the risk occurring, or being about to occur, can be detected and recognized. Where the risk occurrence can be detected easily, detectability is high.
u nConnectivity. The extent to which the risk is related to other individual project risks. Where a risk is connected 
to many other risks, connectivity is high.
u nStrategic impact. The potential for the risk to have a positive or negative effect on the organization’s strategic 
goals. Where the risk has a major effect on strategic goals, strategic impact is high.
u nPropinquity. The degree to which a risk is perceived to matter by one or more stakeholders. Where a risk is 
perceived as very signiﬁcant, propinquity is high.
The consideration of some of these characteristics can provide a more robust prioritization of risks than is possible 
by only assessing probability and impact.

Risks can also be categorized by common root causes. Risk categories that may be used for the project are deﬁned in the risk management plan.
Grouping risks into categories can lead to the development of more effective risk responses by focusing attention and 
effort on the areas of highest risk exposure, or by developing generic risk responses to address groups of related risks.

Data representation techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to:
uuProbability and impact matrix. A probability and impact matrix is a grid for mapping the probability of each 
risk occurrence and its impact on project objectives if that risk occurs. This matrix speciﬁes combinations of probability and impact that allow individual project risks to be divided into priority groups (see 
An organization can assess a risk separately for each objective (e.g., cost, time, and scope) by having a separate 
probability and impact matrix for each. Alternatively, it may develop ways to determine one overall priority level for each risk, either by combining assessments for different objectives, or by taking the highest priority level regardless of which objective is affected.
uuHierarchical charts. Where risks have been categorized using more than two parameters, the probability and 
impact matrix cannot be used and other graphical representations are required. For example, a bubble chart displays three dimensions of data, where each risk is plotted as a disk (bubble), and the three parameters are represented by the x-axis value, the y-axis value, and the bubble size.

To undertake qualitative risk analysis, the project team may conduct a specialized meeting (often called a risk 
workshop) dedicated to the discussion of identiﬁed individual project risks. The goals of this meeting include the review 
of previously identiﬁed risks, assessment of probability and impacts (and possibly other risk parameters), categorization, and prioritization. A risk owner, who will be responsible for planning an appropriate risk response and for reporting progress on managing the risk, will be allocated to each individual project risk as part of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. The meeting may start by reviewing and conﬁrming the probability and impact scales to be used for the analysis. The meeting may also identify additional risks during the discussion, and these should be recorded for analysis. Use of a skilled facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting.

Quantita tive risk analysis requires inputs to a quantitative risk analysis model that reﬂect individual project risks and 
other sources of uncertainty.
Where the duration, cost, or resource requirement for a planned activity is uncertain, the range of possible values 
can be represented in the model as a probability distribution. This may take several forms. The most commonly used 
are triangular, normal, lognormal, beta, uniform, or discrete distributions. Care should be taken when selecting an appropriate probability distribution to reﬂect the range of possible values for the planned activity.
Individual project risks may be covered by probability distributions. Alternatively, risks may be included in the 
model as probabilistic branches, where optional activities are added to the model to represent the time and/or cost impact of the risk should it occur, and the chance that these activities actually occur in a particular simulation run matches the risk’s probability. Branches are most useful for risks that might occur independently of any planned activity. Where risks are related, for example, with a common cause or a logical dependency, correlation is used in the model to indicate this relationship.
Other sources of uncertainty may also be represented using branches to describe alternative paths through 
the project.43311.4.2.5",[]

Data analysis techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to:
uuSimulation. Quantitative risk analysis uses a model that simulates the combined effects of individual project risks 
and other sources of uncertainty to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. Simulations 
are typically performed using a Monte Carlo analysis. When running a Monte Carlo analysis for cost risk, the simulation uses the project cost estimates. When running a Monte Carlo analysis for schedule risk, the schedule network diagram and duration estimates are used. An integrated quantitative cost-schedule risk analysis uses both inputs. The output is a quantitative risk analysis model.
Computer software is used to iterate the quantitative risk analysis model several thousand times. The input 
values (e.g., cost estimates, duration estimates, or occurrence of probabilistic branches) are chosen at random for each iteration. Outputs represent the range of possible outcomes for the project (e.g., project end date, project cost at completion). Typical outputs include a histogram presenting the number of iterations where a particular outcome resulted from the simulation, or a cumulative probability distribution (S-curve) representing the probability of achieving any particular outcome or less. An example S-curve from a Monte Carlo cost risk analysis is ainty434 Part 1 - GuideFor a quantitative schedule risk analysis, it is also possible to conduct a criticality analysis that determines which 
elements of the risk model have the greatest effect on the project critical path. A criticality index is calculated for each element in the risk model, which gives the frequency with which that element appears on the critical path during the simulation, usually expressed as a percentage. The output from a criticality analysis allows the project team to focus risk response planning efforts on those activities with the highest potential effect on the overall schedule performance of the project.
uuSensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis helps to determine which individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty have the most potential impact on project outcomes. It correlates variations in project outcomes with variations in elements of the quantitative risk analysis model.
One typical display of sensitivity analysis is the tornado diagram, which presents the calculated correlation 
coefﬁcient for each element of the quantitative risk analysis model that can inﬂuence the project outcome. This can include individual project risks, project activities with high degrees of variability, or speciﬁc sources of ambiguity. Items are ordered by descending strength of correlation, giving the typical tornado appearance.  
An example tornado diagram is 435uuDecision tree analysis. Decision trees are used to support selection of the best of several alternative courses of 
action. Alternative paths through the project are shown in the decision tree using branches representing different decisions or events, each of which can have associated costs and related individual project risks (including both threats and opportunities). The end-points of branches in the decision tree represent the outcome from following that particular path, which can be negative or positive.
The decision tree is evaluated by calculating the expected monetary value of each branch, allowing the optimal 
path to be selected. An example decision tree 436 Part 1 - GuideuuInfluence diagrams. Inﬂuence diagrams are graphical aids to decision making under uncertainty. An inﬂuence 
diagram represents a project or situation within the project as a set of entities, outcomes, and inﬂuences, together with the relationships and effects between them. Where an element in the inﬂuence diagram is uncertain as a result of the existence of individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty, this can be represented in the inﬂuence diagram using ranges or probability distributions. The inﬂuence diagram is then evaluated using a simulation technique, such as Monte Carlo analysis, to indicate which elements have the greatest inﬂuence on key outcomes. Outputs from an inﬂuence diagram are similar to other quantitative risk analysis methods, including S-curves and tornado diagrams.

described in Section 11.2.3.2. The risk report will be updated to reﬂect the results of the quantitative risk analysis. This will typically include:
uuAssessment of overall project risk exposure. Overall project risk is reﬂected in two key measures:
u nChances of project success, indicated by the probability that the project will achieve its key objectives (e.g., required end date or interim milestones, required cost target, etc.) given the identiﬁed individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty; and
u nDegree of inherent variability remaining within the project at the time the analysis was conducted, indicated by the range of possible project outcomes.
uuDetailed probabilistic analysis of the project. Key outputs from the quantitative risk analysis are presented, such as S-curves, tornado diagrams, and criticality analysis, together with a narrative interpretation of the results. Possible detailed results of a quantitative risk analysis may include:
u nAmount of contingency reserve needed to provide a speciﬁed level of conﬁdence;
u nIdentiﬁcation of individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty that have the greatest effect on the project critical path; and
u nMajor drivers of overall project risk, with the greatest inﬂuence on uncertainty in project outcomes.
uuPrioritized list of individual project risks. This list includes those individual project risks that pose the greatest threat or present the greatest opportunity to the project, as indicated by sensitivity analysis.
uuTrends in quantitative risk analysis results. As the analysis is repeated at different times during the project life 
cycle, trends may become apparent that inform the planning of risk responses.
uuRecommended risk responses. The risk report may present suggested responses to the level of overall project risk exposure or key individual project risks, based on the results of the quantitative risk analysis. These recommendations will form inputs to the Plan Risk Responses process.439Effective and appropriate risk responses can minimize individual threats, maximize individual opportunities, and 
reduce overall project risk exposure. Unsuitable risk responses can have the converse effect. Once risks have been 
identiﬁed, analyzed, and prioritized, plans should be developed by the nominated risk owner for addressing every individual project risk the project team considers to be sufﬁciently important, either because of the threat it poses to the project objectives or the opportunity it offers. The project manager should also consider how to respond appropriately to the current level of overall project risk.
Risk responses should be appropriate for the signiﬁcance of the risk, cost-effective in meeting the challenge, realistic 
within the project context, agreed upon by all parties involved, and owned by a responsible person. Selecting the optimal risk response from several options is often required. The strategy or mix of strategies most likely to be effective should be selected for each risk. Structured decision-making techniques may be used to choose the most appropriate response. For large or complex projects, it may be appropriate to use a mathematical optimization model or real options analysis as a basis for a more robust economic analysis of alternative risk response strategies.
Speciﬁc actions are developed to implement the agreed-upon risk response strategy, including primary and backup 
strategies, as necessary. A contingency plan (or fallback plan) can be developed for implementation if the selected strategy turns out not to be fully effective or if an accepted risk occurs. Secondary risks should also be identiﬁed. Secondary risks are risks that arise as a direct result of implementing a risk response. A contingency reserve is often allocated for time or cost. If developed, it may include identiﬁcation of the conditions that trigger its use.

uuResource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Resource calendars identify when potential resources are available to be allocated to agreed-upon risk responses.
uuRisk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register contains details of individual project risks that have been identiﬁed and prioritized, and for which risk responses are required. The priority level for each risk can help to guide the selection of appropriate risk responses. For example, high-priority threats or opportunities may require priority action and highly proactive response strategies. Threats and opportunities in the low-priority zone may not require proactive management action beyond being placed in the risk register as part of the watch list or adding a contingency reserve.
The risk register identiﬁes the nominated risk owner for each risk. It may also contain preliminary risk responses 
identiﬁed earlier in the Project Risk Management process. The risk register may provide other data on identiﬁed risks that can assist in planning risk responses, including root causes, risk triggers and warning signs, risks requiring responses in the near term, and risks where a need for additional analysis has been identiﬁed.
uuRisk report. Described in Section 11.2.3.2. The risk report presents the current level of overall risk exposure of the project that will inform selection of the risk response strategy. The risk report may also list individual project risks in priority order and provide additional analysis of the distribution of individual project risks that may inform risk response selection.

Five alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with threats, as follows:
uuEscalate. Escalation is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that a threat is outside 
the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project manager’s authority. Escalated 
risks are managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant part of the organization, and not on the project level. The project manager determines who should be notiﬁed about the threat and communicates the details to that person or part of the organization. It is important that ownership of escalated threats is accepted by the relevant party in the organization. Threats are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives that would be affected if the threat occurred. Escalated threats are not monitored further by the project team after escalation, although they may be recorded in the risk register for information.443uuAvoid. Risk avoidance is when the project team acts to eliminate the threat or protect the project from its 
impact. It may be appropriate for high-priority threats with a high probability of occurrence and a large negative 
impact. Avoidance may involve changing some aspect of the project management plan or changing the objective that is in jeopardy in order to eliminate the threat entirely, reducing its probability of occurrence to zero. The risk owner may also take action to isolate the project objectives from the risk’s impact if it were to occur. Examples of avoidance actions may include removing the cause of a threat, extending the schedule, changing the project strategy, or reducing scope. Some risks can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information, improving communication, or acquiring expertise.
uuTransfer. Transfer involves shifting ownership of a threat to a third party to manage the risk and to bear the impact if the threat occurs. Risk transfer often involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the threat. Transfer can be achieved by a range of actions, which include but are not limited to the use of insurance, performance bonds, warranties, guarantees, etc. Agreements may be used to transfer ownership and liability for speciﬁed risks to another party.
uuMitigate. In risk mitigation, action is taken to reduce the probability of occurrence and/or impact of a threat. Early mitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the threat has occurred. Adopting less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable seller are examples of mitigation actions. Mitigation may involve prototype development (see Section 5.2.2.8) to reduce the risk of scaling up from a bench-scale model of a process or product. Where it is not possible to reduce probability, a mitigation response might reduce the impact by targeting factors that drive the severity. For example, designing redundancy into a system may reduce the impact from a failure of the original component.
uuAccept. Risk acceptance acknowledges the existence of a threat, but no proactive action is taken. This strategy may be appropriate for low-priority threats, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address a threat in any other way. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to handle the threat if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the threat to ensure that it does not change signiﬁcantly.444 Part 1 - Guide11.5.2.5",['Section 5.2.2.8)']

Five alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with opportunities, as follows:
uuEscalate. This risk response strategy is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that 
an opportunity is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project 
manager’s authority. Escalated opportunities are managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant part of the organization, and not on the project level. The project manager determines who should be notiﬁed about the opportunity and communicates the details to that person or part of the organization. It is important that ownership of escalated opportunities is accepted by the relevant party in the organization. Opportunities are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives that would be affected if the opportunity occurred. Escalated opportunities are not monitored further by the project team after escalation, although they may be recorded in the risk register for information.
uuExploit. The exploit strategy may be selected for high-priority opportunities where the organization wants to ensure that the opportunity is realized. This strategy seeks to capture the beneﬁt associated with a particular opportunity by ensuring that it deﬁnitely happens, increasing the probability of occurrence to 100%. Examples of exploiting responses may include assigning an organization’s most talented resources to the project to reduce the time to completion, or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration.
uuShare. Sharing involves transferring ownership of an opportunity to a third party so that it shares some of the beneﬁt if the opportunity occurs. It is important to select the new owner of a shared opportunity carefully so they are best able to capture the opportunity for the beneﬁt of the project. Risk sharing often involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the opportunity. Examples of sharing actions include forming risk-sharing partnerships, teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures.
uuEnhance. The enhance strategy is used to increase the probability and/or impact of an opportunity. Early 
enhancement action is often more effective than trying to improve the beneﬁt after the opportunity has occurred. The probability of occurrence of an opportunity may be increased by focusing attention on its causes. Where it is not possible to increase probability, an enhancement response might increase the impact by targeting factors that drive the size of the potential beneﬁt. Examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources to an activity to ﬁnish early.
uuAccept. Accepting an opportunity acknowledges its existence but no proactive action is taken. This strategy may be appropriate for low-priority opportunities, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address an opportunity in any other way. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to take advantage of the opportunity if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the opportunity to ensure that it does not change signiﬁcantly.44511.5.2.6",[]

Some responses are designed for use only if certain events occur. For some risks, it is appropriate for the project 
team to make a response plan that will only be executed under certain predeﬁned conditions, if it is believed that 
there will be sufﬁcient warning to implement the plan. Events that trigger the contingency response, such as missing intermediate milestones or gaining higher priority with a seller, should be deﬁned and tracked. Risk responses identiﬁed using this technique are often called contingency plans or fallback plans and include identiﬁed triggering events that set the plans in effect.

Risk responses should be planned and implemented not only for individual project risks but also to address overall 
project risk. The same risk response strategies that are used to deal with individual project risks can also be applied to 
overall project risk:
uuAvoid. Where the level of overall project risk is signiﬁcantly negative and outside the agreed-upon risk 
thresholds for the project, an avoid strategy may be adopted. This involves taking focused action to reduce the negative effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole and bring the project back within the thresholds. An example of avoidance at the overall project level would include removal of high-risk elements of scope from the project. Where it is not possible to bring the project back within the thresholds, the project may be canceled. This represents the most extreme degree of risk avoidance and it should be used only if the overall level of threat is, and will remain, unacceptable.
uuExploit. Where the level of overall project risk is signiﬁcantly positive and outside the agreed-upon risk thresholds 
for the project, an exploit strategy may be adopted. This involves taking focused action to capture the positive effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. An example of exploiting at the overall project level would include addition of high-beneﬁt elements of scope to the project to add value or beneﬁts to stakeholders. Alternatively the risk thresholds for the project may be modiﬁed with the agreement of key stakeholders in order to embrace the opportunity.
uuTransfer/share. If the level of overall project risk is high but the organization is unable to address it effectively, 
a third party may be involved to manage the risk on behalf of the organization. Where overall project risk is negative, a transfer strategy is required, which may involve payment of a risk premium. In the case of high positive overall project risk, ownership may be shared in order to reap the associated beneﬁts. Examples of both transfer and share strategies for overall project risk include but are not limited to setting up a collaborative business structure in which the buyer and the seller share the overall project risk, launching a joint venture or special-purpose company, or subcontracting key elements of the project.446 Part 1 - GuideuuMitigate/enhance. These strategies involve changing the level of overall project risk to optimize the chances 
of achieving the project’s objectives. The mitigation strategy is used where overall project risk is negative, and 
enhancement applies when it is positive. Examples of mitigation or enhancement strategies include replanning the project, changing the scope and boundaries of the project, modifying project priority, changing resource allocations, adjusting delivery times, etc.
uuAccept. Where no proactive risk response strategy is possible to address overall project risk, the organization 
may choose to continue with the project as currently deﬁned, even if overall project risk is outside the agreed-upon thresholds. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish an overall contingency reserve for the project, including amounts of time, money, or resources to be used if the project exceeds its thresholds. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the level of overall project risk to ensure that it does not change signiﬁcantly.

A number of alternative risk response strategies may be considered. Data analysis techniques that can be used to 
select a preferred risk response strategy include but are not limited to:
uuAlternatives analysis. A simple comparison of the characteristics and requirements of alternative risk response options can lead to a decision on which response is most appropriate.
uuCost-benefit analysis. If the impact of an individual project risk can be quantiﬁed in monetary terms, then the cost-effectiveness of alternative risk response strategies can be determined using cost-beneﬁt analysis (see Section 8.1.2.3). The ratio of (change in impact level) divided by (implementation cost) gives the cost effectiveness of the response strategy, with a higher ratio indicating a more effective response.

Decision-making techniques that can be used to select a risk response strategy include but are not limited to

Criteria for risk response selection may include but are not limited to cost of response, likely effectiveness of response in changing probability and/or impact, resource availability, timing constraints (urgency, proximity, and dormancy), level of impact if the risk occurs, effect of response on related risks, introduction of secondary risks, etc. Different strategies may be selected later in the project if the original choice proves to be ineffective.44711.5.3 PL AN RISK RE SPONSES : OUTPUTS

executed. A common problem with Project Risk Management is that project teams spend effort in identifying and 
analyzing risks and developing risk responses, then risk responses are agreed upon and documented in the risk register and risk report, but no action is taken to manage the risk.
Only if risk owners give the required level of effort to implementing the agreed-upon responses will the overall risk

Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
uuTechnical performance analysis. Technical performance analysis compares technical accomplishments during project execution to the schedule of technical achievement. It requires the deﬁnition of objective, quantiﬁable measures of technical performance, which can be used to compare actual results against targets. Such technical performance measures may include weight, transaction times, number of delivered defects, storage capacity, etc. Deviation can indicate the potential impact of threats or opportunities.
uuReserve analysis. Described in Section 7.2.2.6. Throughout execution of the project, some individual project risks may occur with positive or negative impacts on budget or schedule contingency reserves. Reserve analysis compares the amount of the contingency reserves remaining to the amount of risk remaining at any time in the project in order to determine if the remaining reserve is adequate. This may be communicated using various graphical representations, including a burndown chart.

Described in Section 8.2.2.5. Risk audits are a type of audit that may be used to consider the effectiveness of the risk 
management process. The project manager is responsible for ensuring that risk audits are performed at an appropriate frequency, as deﬁned in the project’s risk management plan. Risk audits may be included during routine project review meetings or may form part of a risk review meeting, or the team may choose to hold separate risk audit meetings. The format for the risk audit and its objectives should be clearly deﬁned before the audit is conducted.45711.7.2.3",['Section 8.2.2.5.']

Meetings that can be used during this process include but are not limited to risk reviews. Risk reviews are scheduled 
regularly and should examine and document the effectiveness of risk responses in dealing with overall project risk 
and with identiﬁed individual project risks. Risk reviews may also result in identiﬁcation of new individual project risks, (including secondary risks that arise from agreed-upon risk responses), reassessment of current risks, the closing of risks that are outdated, issues that have arisen as the result of risks that have occurred, and identiﬁcation of lessons to be learned for implementation in ongoing phases in the current project or in similar projects in the future. The risk review may be conducted as part of a periodic project status meeting or a dedicated risk review meeting may be held, as speciﬁed in the risk management plan.
